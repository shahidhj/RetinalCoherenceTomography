# RetinalCoherenceTomography
Retinal Coherence Tomography involves using the x-ray images of the retina to detect the damages caused to it. The damages caused are divided into three categories - Drusen, Coherence Neo Vascular(CNV) and  This project consists of around 85000 images to train the neural network. The architecture consists of a pre-trained network(Resnet34) and accuracy obtained is 93.84%
