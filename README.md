# Retinal Coherence Tomography
Retinal Coherence Tomography involves using the x-ray images of the retina to detect the damages caused to it. The images are divided into four categories - Drusen, Coherence Neo Vascular(CNV) ,Diabetic Macular Edema(DME) which are the diffrent kinds of damages caused to the retina and the fourth category being a normal image of an eye. This project consists of around 85000 images to train the neural network. The architecture consists of a pre-trained network(Resnet34) and accuracy obtained is 93.84%


This project uses fast.ai library which is open source and can be used under a MIT license.The fast.ai library is built on top of Torch.
